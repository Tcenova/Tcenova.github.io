### Projects planned for after college

Once I finsh up my thesis I have many projects in the planning stages. Almost all contain elements of hardware and software design, especially exploring interfaces and protocols I have not had experience with. Below is a list of the projects at a high level, and there will be sections below with an overview of each.

* DS3/DS4 wireless to PS2/PS1 adapter.
* PS2 Digital RGB video to HDMI.
* Smart BLE 5 TV/Universal remote. 
* New desktop (Or at least a refresh of OS/maybe GPU).
